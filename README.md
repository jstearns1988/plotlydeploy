## From Bacteria to Beef: Overview of the analysis

Roza is a biological researcher in a prominent microbiology laboratory. Many Bacterial species are not well studied, and many more remain unknown to science. Rosa’s role is to discover and document these bacteria. In particular, Rosa is interested in bacterial species that have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Her lab has partnered with Improbably Beef, a food starts to research candidate species. Labs across the country have had success in synthesizing meat from algae, fungi, and microorganisms found on plant roots. However, Improbably Beef is still searching fro the elusive bacteria that will provide the perfect taste. Rosa has a hypothesis that there’s a microorganism that can supply the next best taste, and she believes it can be found quite close to home from bacteria found on the human body. 

Here’s what Rosa knows so far: The human body Is a source of thousands of types of bacteria, and different parts of the body harbor different species. Bacteria found in the gut are not the same species that are found on a person’s eyelashes for example. Furthermore, between individuals the bacterial species may vary evening the same location. Rosa hypothesizes that the ideal bacterial species to make synthetic beef may be found in the belly button

To test her hypothesis, Rosa has sampled the navels of people across the country to identify bacterial species that colonize our belly buttons. Each person’s identity is anonymous. They’ve instead been assigned an ID number. I built a dashboard that both her research participants and fellow researchers can access. Those who participated in the study will be able to visit this website and select their ID numbers to see which bacterial species live in their navels. Who knows what they might find?!

## Results

This interactive dashboard allows users to select the Test Subject ID No. and automatically generate a bar chart of the Top 10 Bacteria Culters found, a gauge that reflects how many times the participant's bells button is washed per week, and a bubble chart with the Bacteria Species per Sample. You can also view the demographic information to draw comparisons.
